# Assignment 2 (100 points) — Operation Knock-Knock, Security and Vulnerability Analysis - S15, CSE 591 ASU

## Description

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to write a web application on behalf of the super secret spy agency: CSE591.

You will build a web application that hides in plain sight, with hidden functionality that only our secret agents know exists.

The main functionality of your web application will have user registration, login, logout, as well as, a message board, with users able to post messages.

Each user will have a unique “knock sequence” (described later). Once the secret “knock sequence” of URLs is requested by a logged-in session, your application must switch into “secret” mode. Everything should remain the same, except now secret messages will be shown and posted.
